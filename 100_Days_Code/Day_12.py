🛑 Problem in Your Code
❌ You start your loop at i = 1 and check num % (i+1)
This means:
- You start dividing by 2, 3, 4, ... — but you never check 1, and you never skip it either.
- Also, you check num % 1 == 0 for every number, which is always true, so it wrongly returns False for every input.

Yes — the first version using while True: has clear advantages over the second one. Here's a breakdown of why the first one is better:

✅ Version 1 — Input Loop (recommended):
while True:
    try:
        user_guess = int(input("Make a guess: "))
        break  # Exit loop if input is valid
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")
        continue
        
✅ Benefits:
Keeps prompting until valid input is received.
Ensures that the program never proceeds with invalid data.
Clean and reusable input-validation pattern.
Prevents user_guess from being undefined or invalid.


⚠️ Version 2 — Single try-except block:
try:
    user_guess = int(input("Make a guess: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
    continue
    
⚠️ Problems:
This only handles one input attempt.
After printing the error message, continue applies to the outer loop, which could cause unintended behavior if not structured properly.
If placed in the wrong spot (e.g. not within a containing loop), it may crash or skip logic because user_guess may not be defined.
Not self-contained — relies on outer control flow to work correctly.

| Feature                         | `while True:` Version ✅ | Single try-except ❌ |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Keeps asking until valid input  | ✅                       | ❌                   |
| Prevents undefined `user_guess` | ✅                       | ❌                   |
| Safer and cleaner               | ✅                       | ❌                   |
| Reusable in many places         | ✅                       | ⚠️ Somewhat         |

✅ Verdict:
Use the first version with while True: — it’s safer, clearer, and more robust.
