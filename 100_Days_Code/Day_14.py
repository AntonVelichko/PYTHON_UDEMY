# Only run the game if this script is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    game()

'''
Why do this?
When your script is imported as a module in another Python file, everything outside a function 
will run immediatelyâ€”which is usually not what you want. By wrapping your main logic like this, you ensure:
game() only runs when this file is executed directly (not when it's imported elsewhere).
Other scripts can safely import your helper functions without starting the game.
