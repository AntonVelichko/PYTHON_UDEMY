  pdb.set_trace()                 # better way to see what is going on
  t = 4 * 2
  return num1 + num2

add(4, 4)

# pdb commands
# <parametr_name> then 'next'  -  to see what is inside (in our case it is num1, num2)
# help
# help <command_name_from_help_list>
# a - showing all arguments
# w  - showing the context of the current line that executing

# step - moving code line by line every time step is called
# in 'step' command 'continue' will run the code until it hits an error
